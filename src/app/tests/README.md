## Northbound API Tests

This project includes a suite of tests to verify that the Northbound APIs are functioning correctly and returning expected results.

### Running the Tests

To execute the test suite using `pytest`, run the following command:

```bash
pytest -vs -s
```

* `-v` or `--verbose`: Increases verbosity to show detailed output.
* `-s`: Disables output capturing to allow print statements to appear in the console.
